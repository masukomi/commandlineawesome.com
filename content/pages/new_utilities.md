New utilities folks have come up with.

  * [z](https://github.com/rupa/z)
  * [fasd](https://github.com/clvv/fasd)
  * [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump)
  * [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
* environment management
    * [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) 
      > asdf is a CLI tool that can manage multiple language runtime versions on a per-project basis. It is like gvm, nvm, rbenv & pyenv (and more) all in one! Simply install your language's plugin!
    * [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv)
      > direnv is an extension for your shell. It augments existing shells with a new feature that can load and unload environment variables depending on the current directory.
* file management
    * [broot](https://github.com/Canop/broot) "A better way to navigate directories"
    * [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn)
      > nnn (nÂ³) is a full-featured terminal file manager. It's tiny, nearly 0-config and incredibly fast.
      > 
      > It is designed to be unobtrusive with smart workflows to match the trains of thought.
      > 
      > nnn can analyze disk usage, batch rename, launch apps and pick files. The plugin repository has tons of plugins to extend the capabilities further e.g. live previews, (un)mount disks, find & list, file/dir diff, upload files. A patch framework hosts sizable user-submitted patches which are subjective in nature.
    * [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)
